    <h1> Filet Mignon for Two </h1>

    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Filet mignon with Gorgonzola sauce is a very simple and delicious meal for two. A good sear on your steak will ensure a juicy, tender steak. I have found this to be the best way to cook a steak indoors.  </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) filet mignon steaks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Gorgonzola Sauce</li>
    </ul>


    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Place a large, oven-proof skillet in the oven as it preheats.</li>
        <li>Bring steaks to room temperature. Rub with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Remove the hot skillet from the oven carefully and place it on a burner set to high heat. Leave the oven on.</li>
        <li>Place steaks into the dry pan immediately and sear, turning with tongs, 1 to 2 minutes on both sides.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pan back into the preheated oven and cook until desired doneness is reached, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>For medium doneness, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer steaks to a warm platter and tent loosely with foil. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes; the steaks will continue to cook during this process and the internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees. Serve sauce with steaks.</li>
    </ol>
